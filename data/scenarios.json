            "Emissions & Warming": "GHG emissions peak around 2050 and then decline, leading to a moderate warming scenario (~2.7–3.2°C by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels).",

            "Socioeconomic Assumptions": "Socioeconomic Assumptions: Rapid economic growth driven by fossil fuel use, high population growth in some regions, and minimal concern for sustainability.",
            "Climate Policy": "Little to no mitigation, with economic and technological development favoring energy-intensive industries.",
            "Emissions & Warming": "GHG emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century, leading to an extreme warming scenario (~4.4°C or higher by 2100).",
            "Energy & Land Use": "Heavy reliance on coal, oil, and gas, leading to high carbon emissions, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation."
